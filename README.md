### Why Provide This Chat ID? Is It Safe?

- **What is a chat ID?**  
  Your chat ID is a public identification value used in Telegram. It’s how Telegram connects you to the people you talk to.
  
- **Why does the bot need my chat ID?**  
  The demo bot requires your chat ID to interact with you on Telegram, just like any other user or bot.
  
- **Is it safe to share my chat ID?**  
  Yes! Your chat ID is publicly available when you communicate with others on Telegram, and it doesn’t expose any sensitive information.
  
- **Potential risks of chat ID leakage?**  
  The main risk is that someone could contact you on Telegram if they know your chat ID. However, no critical information is exposed.
